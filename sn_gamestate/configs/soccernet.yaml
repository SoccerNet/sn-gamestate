# TrackLab SoccerNet config

# The defaults list contains the files that will be used
# to create the final config file. This item *must* be
# the first element in the file.
# Detailed configs for each default component below are located in "sn-gamestate/sn-gamestate/configs" and "tracklab/tracklab/configs"
# Define here which implementation (yolov8, oc_sort, ..) to use for each generic (detection, tracking, ...) component.
defaults:
  - dataset: soccernet_gs
  - eval: trackeval
  - engine: offline
  - state: save  # Dump tracking results to a .pcklz file to save computation time on the next run. Have a look at TrackLab tutorials for more details.
  - visualization: gamestate  # Save tracking results as a .mp4 video in the run directory specified below (sn-gamestate/outputs/...)

# Pipeline definition :
# - Defines the order in which the modules will be called
# - If loading a tracking state from disk, remove modules whose outputs are already provided in the loaded state

# Dataset
dataset:
  nvid: 1  # For a quick first inference, only one random video is processed. Use "-1" to process all the videos.
  eval_set: "validation"  # Tracking is performed on the SoccerNet validation set. Choose from {"train", "validation", "test", "challenge"}.
  dataset_path: ${data_dir}/SoccerNetGS  # The SoccerNet game state dataset is located under the data path (defined above) in the 'SoccerNetGS' folder

# Tracker state (save computation time by dumping tracking results on disk for later re-use)
state:
  save_file: "states/${experiment_name}.pklz"  # 'null' to disable saving. This is the save path for the tracker_state object that contains all modules outputs (bboxes, reid embeddings, jersey numbers, roles, teams, etc)
  load_file: null  # 'null' to disable loading. Load a file that was saved with the 'state.save_file' option above. Don't forget to remove from the pipeline all modules that should not be run again, but loaded from the saved tracker state.

# Visualization
visualization:
  cfg:
    save_videos: True  # Save a .mp4 video on disk with the game state reconstruction output (see 'tracklab/tracklab/configs/visualization' for more options)
